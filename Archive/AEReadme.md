## Preamble

**NOTE**: AVO-AE **REQUIRES** the paid update to Skyrim.

Animonculory Visual Overhaul **Anniversary Edition** (AVO-AE) is designed as a base for your own modlist. Featuring graphical enhancements, mandatory bug fixes and tweaks and method patching, it is the perfect base to build upon. AVO is made for Skyrim Special Edition Version 1.6.353 (also known as Anniversary Edition) and uses the .exe of that version as well. It uses [Solas Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49004) by default; however, it can support whichever weather mod you wish to use.

The full modlist can be viewed [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/animonculory-visual-overhaul), a selection of screenshots can be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/mcpBqFW) and a video showcase by DroppedIceCream can be viewed below.

## System Requirements

AVO-AE has been tested extensively on a range of systems and using industry standard testing software to determine the required specs for the list. As such, the following specs are recommended to run the list.

| Spec Category | Minimum for 30fps | Recommended for 60fps |
|     :---:    |     :---:      |     :---:     |
| **CPU**   | 6 core/thread @ 2.3Ghz. i9-9600t or better. | 8 Core/16 Thread CPU. i9-9900k or better. |
| **Video Card**    | 6GB Vram clocked between 1290 and 1390. If you have an overcloked model with 4GB (such as a GTX 1060 laptop), you may be able to run it. A card such as the GTX 1060 would work for this. | 8+GB VRAM, but no more than 10 needed, clocked between 1400 and 1500. A card such as a GTX 1080 or 1080ti or better would be ideal.      |
| **Ram**    | 6GB DDR5 with some stuttering.      | 8-10GB DDR5 for smoothest experience. 16GB DDR4/5 advised.     |
| **With ENB**     | +15% to required resources.       | +10% to required resources.      |
| **Expected peformance**    | 35fps outdoors wiith 40+ indoors. Loading times between 20 to 30 seconds.       | 59-112fps outdoors and indoors with loading times around 10 to 15 seconds. Cap FPS to achieve smoother experience.      |
| **Expected non ENB performance**    | 40fps outdoors with 50fps indoors. Loading times between 15 and 40 seconds.      | 100+ fps both outdoors and indoors with loading times between 5 and 15 seconds.     |

Space required: Approx 130GB (Downloads included)

## Installation

Installing AVO-AE is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing AVO-AE, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location.
5. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
6. You also need to start the games to the main menu in order to download all the creations.
7. Install the [Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit from steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/).

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

#### Downloading and Installing AVO-AE

Downloading and installing AVO-AE can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install AVO, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists.
2. Press the download button on AVO-AE and wait for it to download.
3. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like `C:\Games\AVOAE`. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
4. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing. Alternatively read through this readme again.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

##### Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
	- Make sure that you have downloaded **all** of the creation club content. **THIS LIST WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT IT!**

- x is not a whitelisted download:

	 - This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file which is needed for Mod Organizer. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## Post-Installation

### Game Folder

AVO-AE uses a Wabbajack feature called Stock Game to keep your Skyrim installation clean. All the files that you need to run the list are in a folder called `Game Root`. You donâ€™t need to copy anything at all.

### ENB
AVO-AE is designed for use with an ENB and comes with [Solas Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49004), already activated and ready for use. The ENB has been custom tweaked for the list to match the intended look, feel and performance of the list. 

If you wish to install your own ENB, however, an ENB manager is included. Simply put your new ENB into a seperate folder in `AVOAE\Tools\ENB Organizer\Games\SkyrimSE\Presets`.

#### Using ENB Manager

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once it's launched, there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big `Run` button next to it. Run the program named `Pick Your ENB` from Mod Organizer 2.

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/ENB%201.png?raw=true)

If the image below comes up, simply press OK. It is nothing to be concerned about.

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/Ignore%20Warning.png?raw=true)

Navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

![image](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/.github/ENB%203.png?raw=true)

Activate the ENB you wish to use by pressing the slider. To deactivate it, simply press the slider.

For adding your own presets and more details, take a look at [ENB Organizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67077) for more information.

## Playing the List

### Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `SKSE` and press the `Run` button.

### In-Game MCM options
`AVO-AE has no MCM options required, however you can load the SmoothCam preset if you wish.`

- This serves as a placeholder in case you want to use the Readme as some sort of template.

### Starting the Game

- Placeholder for your Readme. By default, AVO-AE uses [Optional Quick Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63953).
	
## Adding mods to AVO-AE

To safely add mods to AVO-AE, please read [the guide](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Adding%20mods%20to%20AVO.md), which covers some of the details you need to know.

## Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.

## FAQ

Placehoder for your Readme.

### Tweaking the Game Settings

#### BethINI

To get some more FPS, tweak the following value in the detail section in BethINI.

- `Shadow Resolution`: 2048
- `Ambient Occlusion`: Either use this or the ENB version. The ENB version is more intensive. Do not have both turned on.
- `Remove Shadows`: I really donâ€™t recommend turning this on, but if you must, then you can.

#### ENB

AVO-AE ships with an ENB setup that is configured to match the look of the list. If you wish to make some changes though, here are a few common tweaks. I recommend opening the console before doing edits.

##### Removing the letterbox (in general as the default ENB doesn't have that effect enabled)

1. Press [Shift+Enter] to open the ENB menu.
2. In the tab called Shader Parameters, select the `ENBPOSTPASS.FX` section. It will open once you click on it.
3. Scroll down until you see letterbox and untick it.
4. Press the save configuration button.
5. Press [Shift+Enter] to return to the game.

##### Turning off settings for FPS

If you are struggling for frames but want the colour correction and realism, turn off the following items.

- DetailedShadows
- ComplexFireLights
- ComplexParticleLights â€“ Disable Big Range
- Reflection
- Complex Grass Collision
- Complex Grass

If you really cannot handle the ENB, uncheck `useEffect`. Note that this will make the list look much worse and it's not intended to be played like that.


#### Skyrim doesn't start but shows up in Task Manager

- Disable the mod ``Skyrim Search`` in MO2 and try again without it. Make sure to end the task in Task Manager first

#### Install fails on Creation Kit.ini

Please install the [Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit from steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/) and restart Wabbajack afterwards.

## Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.
