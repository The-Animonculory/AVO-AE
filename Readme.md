## :information_source: Preamble

Designed as a base to build your list off, **Animonculory Visual Overhaul (AVO)** focuses on bringing the vanilla games visual look up to modern standards without affecting gameplay. Featuring graphical enhancements, mandatory engine and bug fixes, tweaks, method patching and all the tools required, it is the perfect base to build uopn.

AVO is made for Skyrim Special Edition's latest patch (1.6.640/659 at the time of writing) and uses the .exe of that version as well. AVO-AE **REQUIRES** the paid update to Skyrim. If you do not own it, please use the [standard version](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Readme.md).

The full modlist can be viewed [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/animonculory-visual-overhaul) and a showcase video by DroppedIceCream of an older version can be seen below.

## :page_facing_up: Installation

:warning: AVO requires a **COMPLETELY UNMODIFIED** installation of the **LATEST VERSION** of Skyrim. :warning:

Installing AVO is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### :clipboard: Pre-Installation

Prior to installing AVO, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location.
5. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
6. [STEAM ONLY] Start the game to the main menu in order to download all the creations.

### :page_with_curl: Wabbajack Installation

#### :scroll: Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

#### :open_file_folder: Downloading and Installing AVO-AE

Downloading and installing AVO can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install AVO, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists. Check the tickbox that says `show unofficial`.
2. Press the download button on AVO-AE and wait for it to download.
3. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\AVOAE. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
4. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing. Alternatively read through this readme again.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

##### :confused: Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
	- **Make sure you have downloaded all the creation club content!**

- x is not a whitelisted download:

	 - This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file which is needed for Mod Organizer. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## :floppy_disk: Post-Installation

**DO NOT IGNORE THIS SECTION.**

### :file_folder: Root Builder

To enable compatability with the GOG versions of Skyrim, AVO uses a tool known as Root Builder. For more details regarding it, please view [the mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720) and our [guide to it](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Modding-Resources/blob/main/Root%20Builder%20for%20Skyrim%20AE.md).

***

### :telescope: Graphical Post-Processing 

AVO now comes with 2 Reshade Presets and an ENB preset all ready to go. Out of the box, it ships with an ENB enabled, however this can easily be deactivated. Simply untick `NVT ENB`. 

**NOTE!**: Screenshots save to `Overwrite/Root`.

:warning: **ADDING YOUR OWN POST PROCESSING PRESET IS NOT SUPPORTED. PLEASE REFER TO [THE GUIDE](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Adding%20mods%20to%20AVO.md) ON HOW TO CHANGE IT.** :warning:

## :arrow_forward: Playing the List

### :busts_in_silhouette: Profile selection

:exclamation: **DO NOT IGNORE THIS STEP!** :exclamation:

Owing to the list now supporting both steam and GOG editions of the game, you **must select** the correct profile for your game copy. **WARNING!**: Failure to do so will result in your game not starting. **DO NOT IGNORE THIS STEP!**

For Steam, select `AVO [STEAM]`. For GOG, select `AVO [GOG]`.

:exclamation: **DO NOT IGNORE THIS STEP!** :exclamation:

***

### :runner:  Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

:warning: Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to the SKSE corresponding to your game copy (`SKSE [STEAM]` or `SKSE [GOG]`) and press the `Run` button. :warning:

### :bookmark: In-Game MCM options
`AVO has no MCM options required, however you can load the SmoothCam preset if you wish.`

- This serves as a placeholder in case you want to use the Readme as some sort of template.

### :horse_racing: Starting the Game

- Placeholder for your Readme. By default, AVO uses [Optional Quick Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63953).
	
## :wrench: Adding mods to AVO

To safely add mods to AVO, please read [the guide](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul/blob/main/Adding%20mods%20to%20AVO.md), which covers some of the details you need to know.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.

### :nut_and_bolt: Tweaking the Game Settings

#### BethINI

To get some more FPS, tweak the following value in the detail section in BethINI.

- `Shadow Resolution`: 2048
- `Remove Shadows`: I really don’t recommend turning this on, but if you must, then you can.

## :put_litter_in_its_place: Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.
