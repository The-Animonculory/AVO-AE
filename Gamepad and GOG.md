# Make a PS5 controller work with the GOG version of AVO

## Requirements:
- PS5 controller (who could have guessed?)
- DS4 Windows

## Install:

1. download [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases)
2. unpack it
3. run the DS4Windows.exe and leave it open while running the game

## That's it?

Yes. It should work with PS3 and PS4 controllers as well but I only tested it with a PS5 controller.
